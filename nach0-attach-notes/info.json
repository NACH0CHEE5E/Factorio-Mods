  "description": "Patch for Attach Notes, made for my modpack (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/nach0_modpack) but will also fix an issue when running this mod and space exploration and a few other mods, credit must go to the original mod creator 321freddy if you want me to take this down I will!, credit also to Tireon/pmendl as they made a patch i just made it a mod for easy download. Attach notes to combinators, entities... almost everything \r\n + Adds signposts. \r\n\r\nAll notes are saved when you export a blueprint as a string (but you need the mod to read them).",
